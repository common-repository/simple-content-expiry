A simple plugin to add an expiry date to post / page content, using shortcodes.

== Description ==

Some plugins allow you to add an expiry date to entire posts, but this plugin allows more freedom.

This plugin is extremely simple to use; once it is activated you can surround your content with the following shortcode, replacing YYYYMMDD with the date you want the content to expire.

[expire date="yyyymmdd"][/expire]

Example of usage:

[expire date="20120101"]This content will disapear on 01/01/2012![/expire]
